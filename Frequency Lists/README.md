Frequency lists formatted for use with "Immerse With Migaku - Alpha" browser extension version "0.9.10.1" and compatible versions of the Chrome extension.

Migaku does not support frequency numbers in a frequency list.  Instead, frequency is based on the word's position in the frequency file.

Migaku assigns a star value for the first 60,000 words, ranging from ★★★★★ for the first 1,500 entries to ★.

Because a single manga series typically has far less than 60,000 words, a manga-based frequency places everything at ★★★★★, even it appears only one time across a ten-volume series.  To work around this, my manga frequency lists are padded with blank entries to to span 80,000 frequency positions.

Currently, padding puts an equal number of spaces between vocabulary words.
